# Cosmos

> "The cosmos is all that is, over ever was, or ever will be." - Carl Sagan

Cosmos is an iOS app that displays images and videos from our universe while keeping in mind a minimal and user-friendly design. The app was born from a strong desire to learn more about space and software development. I wanted to learn about the app development process by building an app from scratch and releasing it on the App Store.

Building this app taught me about:

* UIKit and Auto Layout
* Networking
* Accessibility
* UIActivityViewController
* Testing
* App Store Connect
* The app submition proccess

Content feature in the app comes from [NASA's APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov), a service that has been offering daily pictures of our universe since 1995. It contains the largest collection of annotated astronomical images on the internet. 

## Contributing

Building this app has been a rewarding experience. Please, feel free to contribute by looking at the pending issues on the Issues tab on GitHub. I'll try to keep it updated with new features and bugs üêõ.
