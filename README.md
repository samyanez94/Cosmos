# Cosmos

> "The cosmos is all that is, over ever was, or ever will be." - Carl Sagan

Cosmos is an iOS app that displays images and videos from our universe by keeping in mind a minimal and user-friendly design. The app was born from a strong desire to learn more about space and software development. I wanted to learn about the app devolpment process by building an app from scratch and releasing in on the App Store.

Building this app taught me about:

* UIKit and Auto Layout
* Networking
* Accessibility
* UIActivityViewController
* Testing
* The app submition proccess and App Store Connect

## Contributing

Building this app has been a rewarding experience. Please, feel free to contribute by looking at the pending issues on the Issues tab on GitHub. I try to keep it updated with new features and bugs üêõ.
