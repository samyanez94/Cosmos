Stars are forming, dying, and leaving an impressive tapestry of dark dusty filaments.  The entire Carina Nebula, cataloged as NGC 3372, spans over 300 light years and lies about 8,500 light-years away in the constellation of Carina. The nebula is composed predominantly of hydrogen gas, which emits the pervasive red glow seen in this highly detailed featured image.  The blue glow in the center is created by a trace amount of glowing oxygen. Young and massive stars located in the nebula's center expel dust when they explode in supernovae.  Eta Carinae, the most energetic star in the nebula's center, was one of the brightest stars in the sky in the 1830s, but then faded dramatically.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1905/CarinaWideField_Willasch_2200.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Great Nebula in Carina","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1905/CarinaWideField_Willasch_1080.jpg"},{"date":"2019-05-08","explanation":"What does Jupiter look like up close? Most images of Jupiter are taken from far away, either from Earth or from a great enough distance that nearly half the planet is visible. This shot, though, was composed from images taken relatively close in, where less than half of the planet was visible.  From here, Jupiter still appears spherical but perspective distortion now makes it look more like a marble.

It's surpringly important to know.  Although presently estimated to be about 300 million light years distant, a more precise determination could be coupled with its known recession speed to help humanity better calibrate the expansion rate of the entire visible universe.  Toward this goal, several images were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in order to help identify key stellar distance markers known as Cepheid variable stars.   Since NGC 4921 is a member of the Coma Cluster of Galaxies, refining its distance would also allow a better distance determination to one of the largest nearby clusters in the local universe. The magnificent spiral NGC 4921 has been informally dubbed anemic because of its low rate of star formation and low surface brightness.

As RS Pup pulsates over a period of about 40 days, its regular changes in brightness are also seen along its surrounding nebula delayed in time, effectively a light echo. Using measurements of the time delay and angular size of the nebula, the known speed of light allows astronomers to geometrically determine the distance to RS Pup to be 6,500 light-years, with a remarkably small error of plus or minus 90 light-years.

A ball of stars numbering in the hundreds of thousands crowded into a region 150 light years across, it lies some 25,000 light-years away. The sharp, color picture of M13 at upper left is familiar to many telescopic imagers. Still, M13's Color vs Magnitude Diagram in the panel below and right, made from the same image data, can offer a more telling view. Also known as a Hertzsprung Russell (HR) diagram it plots the apparent brightness of individual cluster stars against color index. The color index is determined for each star by subtracting its brightness (in magnitudes) measured through a red filter from its brightness measured with a blue filter (B-R). Blue stars are hot and red stars are cool so that astronomical color index ranging from bluer to redder follows the relative stellar temperature scale from left (hot) to right (cool). In M13's HR diagram, the stars clearly fall into distinct groups. The broad swath extending diagonally from the bottom right is the cluster's main sequence. A sharp turn toward the upper right hand corner follows the red giant branch while the blue giants are found grouped in the upper left. Formed at the same time, at first M13's stars were all located along the main sequence by mass, lower mass stars at the lower right. Over time higher mass stars have evolved off the main sequence into red, then blue giants and beyond. In fact, the position of the turn-off from the main sequence to the red giant branch indicates the cluster's age at about 12 billion years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/M13_and_HR_diag_updated6.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Colors and Magnitudes of M13","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/M13_and_HR_diag_updated6_1024.jpg"},{"copyright":"Bruce Waddington","date":"2019-06-14","explanation":"These two mighty galaxies are pulling each other apart.

Therefore, it may look like something bright is shining at the antisolar point near the image center, but actually it is reverse-shining because, from your direction, light is streaming in, not out.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/AnticrepuscularRays_Patekar_5600.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Anticrepuscular Rays Converge Opposite the Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/AnticrepuscularRays_Patekar_1080.jpg"},{"copyright":"Tragoolchitr Jittasaiyapan","date":"2019-06-25","explanation":"Do you know the names of some of the brightest stars? It's likely that you do, even though  some bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of written language. Many world cultures have their own names for the brightest stars, and it is culturally and historically important to remember them.  In the interest of clear global communication, however, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun to designate standardized star names.  Featured above in true color are the 25 brightest stars in the night sky, currently as seen by humans, coupled with their IAU-recognized names. Some star names have interesting meanings, including Sirius (\"the scorcher\" in Latin), Vega (\"falling\" in Arabic), and Antares (\"rival to Mars\" in Greek). It's also likely that other of these bright star names are not familiar to you, even though familiar Polaris is too dim to make this list.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/25BrightestStars_Jittasaiyapan_1500.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"25 Brightest Stars in the Night Sky","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/25BrightestStars_Jittasaiyapan_960.jpg"},{"copyright":"Peter Simmering","date":"2019-06-26","explanation":"Sometimes it's night on the ground but day in the air. As the Earth rotates to eclipse the Sun, sunset rises up from the ground. Therefore, at sunset on the ground, sunlight still shines on clouds above.  Under usual circumstances, a pretty sunset might be visible, but unusual noctilucent clouds float so high up they can be seen well after dark.  Normally too dim to be seen, they may become visible just after sunset during the summer when illuminated by sunlight from below.  Noctilucent clouds are the highest clouds known and thought to be part of polar mesospheric clouds.  Featured here as they appeared two weeks ago, a network of noctilucent clouds was captured not only in the distant sky but in reflection from a small lake just north of Zwolle, Netherlands, with trees in stark silhouette across the horizon.  Unusually bright noctilucent clouds continue to appear over much of northern Europe.  Much about noctilucent clouds has been discovered only over the past decade, while how they form and evolve remains a topic of active research.

Dubbed a solargraph, the unconventional picture was recorded with a tall, tube-shaped pinhole camera using a piece of photographic paper. Fixed to a single spot at Casarano, Italy for the entire exposure, the simple camera continuously records the Sun's daily path as a glowing trail burned into the photosensitive paper. Breaks and gaps in the trails are caused by cloud cover. At the end of the exposure, the paper was scanned to create the digital image. Of course, starting in December the Sun trails peak lower in the sky, near the northern hemisphere's winter solstice.

About 40,000 light-years across, M83 is a member of a group of galaxies that includes active galaxy Centaurus A. In fact, the core of M83 itself is bright at x-ray energies, showing a high concentration of neutron stars and black holes left from an intense burst of star formation.
